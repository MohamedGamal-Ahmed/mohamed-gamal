# 📄 Technical Documentation - Portfolio Project

This document provides a detailed overview of the technical architecture and component structure of the portfolio project.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

The project is built as a Single Page Application (SPA) using **React 19** and **Vite**. It follows a component-driven architecture for high reusability and maintainability.

### Key Directories

- **`/src/components`**: Contains all functional UI components.
- **`/src/constants.tsx`**: Centralized store for all text, translations, and project data.
- **`/src/types.ts`**: TypeScript definitions for data structures.
- **`/public`**: Static assets like images and the favicon.

## 🧩 Key Components

### 1. `App.tsx`
The root component that manages:
- **Global State**: Language (EN/AR) and Theme (Light/Dark).
- **Layout**: High-level grid structure (Bento Grid).
- **Theme Injection**: Applies the `.dark` class to the `<html>` element.

### 2. `BentoCard.tsx`
A wrapper component using `framer-motion` to create consistent, animated cards with hover effects.

### 3. `SkillsSection.tsx`
Displays skills categorized into three groups. It uses internal animations to fill progress bars when they enter the viewport.

### 4. `ExperienceSection.tsx`
A vertical timeline component. It dynamically adjusts its layout (LTR/RTL) based on the current language.

### 5. `ContactForm.tsx`
Handles form inputs and validation. It uses the `fetch` API to send data to **Formspree**. It manages 4 states: `idle`, `loading`, `success`, and `error`.

## 🌐 Localization (i18n)

Instead of a heavy i18n library, the project uses a custom approach:
- A `Language` type (`en` | `ar`).
- A `TRANSLATIONS` object in `constants.tsx` containing key-value pairs for both languages.
- Components access text via `t.keyName` based on the current `lang` state.

---

## 🎨 UI/UX Design

- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling.
- **Theming**: Custom CSS variables defined in `index.html` (e.g., `--bg-color`, `--card-bg`) are used to ensure smooth theme transitions.
- **Animations**: `framer-motion` for scroll-triggered entry animations and interactive hover states.

---

## 🛠️ Build & Deployment

- **Bundler**: Vite is used for rapid development and optimized production builds.
- **Deployment**: The `dist` folder generated by `npm run build` can be hosted on platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages.
